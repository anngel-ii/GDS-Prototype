"Access for All: Simplifying GOV.UK for Every User"

Pitch:

The GOV.UK website is designed to provide essential government information, but many users feel overwhelmed and lost when navigating it. A report by PublicTechnology.net highlights that users often struggle with the site's architecture and the overwhelming amount of information. Despite efforts to improve, the site still falls short in meeting user needs.

My prototype addresses these pain points by focusing on accessibility, personalization, and ease of navigation.

Key Features:
Simplified Landing Page with Sign-In Options:
Users can create and log into accounts, allowing for a more personalized experience. Filters help narrow down searches, making information easier to find.

Language Accessibility (In Progress):
A language selection feature helps non-English speakers access content in their native language—an option currently missing on GOV.UK.

Color-Blind Mode:
A dedicated toggle improves accessibility for users with various types of color blindness, ensuring inclusivity.

Enhanced Search Filters:
Search results can be refined by category, user type, keywords, urgency, and date range, reducing information overload.

Future Improvements (If Given More Time):
Fully functional language settings that adjust the entire site.
Advanced, customizable search filters.
A working color-blind mode toggle.
Backend integration to let users save documents and access personalized content.
Impact:
This prototype transforms the GOV.UK experience by making it more intuitive, inclusive, and user-friendly. It empowers every user—regardless of language or ability—to easily access the information they need.

Thank you.
